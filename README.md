# My Reactified Portfolio
This my new and imprpved portfolio using react to display the app.

I tried to stay true to my previous portfolio.
This means that most of the colors are the same as well as the general layout.  


## Features
The projects all link to their respective github repositories. 
There will the code for them. 
And my contact information is on the bottom.
I feel, in the future I would like to add more to this portfolio, possible make more than just a singular page?
Enough to make it pretty for a potential employer 

## Acknowledgements

throughout the course of the bootcamp. Everyone has faced challenges and I am thankful that we all faced these challenges together
